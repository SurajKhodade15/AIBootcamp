    "| **1. Vanishing Gradient Problem**                    | - During **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**, gradients are propagated backward through multiple time steps.<br>- When activation functions like **tanh** or **sigmoid** are used, the derivatives are less than 1, and repeated multiplication causes gradients to shrink exponentially.<br>- As a result, the model **fails to learn long-term dependencies**.<br> |\n",
    "| **2. Exploding Gradient Problem**                    | - In some cases, gradients may **grow exponentially** during BPTT if the weights are large or unregulated.<br>- This leads to **unstable training**, with weight updates becoming excessively large, causing the model to diverge.<br>- A common mitigation is **gradient clipping**.                                                                                    |\n",
    "| **3. Difficulty in Learning Long-Term Dependencies** | - Simple RNNs are effective at modeling **short-term context**, but struggle to retain information over longer sequences.<br>- The influence of earlier inputs decays with each time step due to gradient flow limitations.                                                                                                                                              |\n",
    "| **4. Lack of Gating Mechanism**                      | - RNNs lack explicit mechanisms (like **gates**) to control what information should be **remembered** or **forgotten**.<br>- This leads to **information overload or loss**, especially in complex sequences.                                                                                                                                                            |\n",
    "| **5. Sequential Processing (Non-Parallelizable)**    | - RNNs process data **sequentially**, one time step at a time.<br>- This limits **parallelization** during training and inference, resulting in **slower execution times**, especially with long sequences.                                                                                                                                                              |\n",
    "| **6. Exposure Bias During Training**                 | - In techniques like **teacher forcing**, the model is trained using the ground truth from the previous step.<br>- However, during inference, the model generates outputs based on its **own predictions**, causing **distribution mismatch**.                                                                                                                           |\n",
    "| **7. High Sensitivity to Initialization**            | - Model performance can be highly dependent on **weight initialization**.<br>- Poor initialization can worsen vanishing/exploding gradient issues and prevent convergence.                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",
    "| **8. Poor Performance on Complex Sequences**         | - Tasks such as **machine translation, summarization, or long document classification** require deeper memory and contextual reasoning, which vanilla RNNs fail to capture effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",
