    "# **Attention Mechanism in Deep Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Attention Mechanism** is a neural network component designed to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence while generating each output step.\n",
    "It solves the problem of **information bottleneck** in traditional Seq2Seq models by allowing the decoder to reference all encoder outputs rather than only the last hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Working Principle**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder Output Storage**:\n",
    "   The encoder processes the input sequence and generates hidden states for each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alignment Scores**:\n",
    "   For the current decoder time step, an alignment score is calculated between the decoder’s current hidden state and each encoder hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Softmax Weighting**:\n",
    "   These scores are passed through a softmax function to generate **attention weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Context Vector Generation**:\n",
    "   The context vector is the weighted sum of encoder hidden states, emphasizing the most relevant inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decoder Output Generation**:\n",
    "   The context vector is combined with the decoder’s hidden state to produce the next predicted token.\n",
