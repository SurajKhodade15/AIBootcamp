    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Encoder–Decoder Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)** architecture is a neural network framework designed to transform one sequence into another. It is widely used in **machine translation, text summarization, conversational AI, and speech recognition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture consists of two primary components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder** – Processes the input sequence and compresses it into a context vector (fixed-length representation).\n",
    "2. **Decoder** – Generates the output sequence from the context vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Encoding Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **encoder** takes the input sequence token by token.\n",
    "* Each token is embedded into a vector and passed through **RNN/LSTM/GRU layers**.\n",
    "* The encoder outputs a **hidden state** that captures the context of the entire input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Context Vector**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **final hidden state** from the encoder becomes the **context vector**.\n",
    "* This vector is a compressed representation of the entire input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Decoding Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **decoder** takes the context vector as its initial hidden state.\n",
    "* It generates tokens one by one for the output sequence.\n",
    "* The previously generated token is fed back into the decoder until the end-of-sequence (EOS) token is generated.\n",
