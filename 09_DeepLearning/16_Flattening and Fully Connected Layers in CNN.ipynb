    "## Flattening and Fully Connected Layers in CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "After a series of **convolution** and **pooling** layers, CNNs produce **feature maps** (multi-dimensional arrays).  \n",
    "To perform final classification or regression, these feature maps must be converted into a **1D vector** and passed into a traditional dense (fully connected) layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Flattening\n",
    "**Flattening** is the process of converting the 2D feature maps (height × width × channels) into a 1D vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a feature map of size \\( h \\times w \\times c \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Flattened Size} = h \\times w \\times c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector is then fed into fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Fully Connected (FC) Layers\n",
    "A **fully connected layer** is a standard ANN dense layer where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.  \n",
    "It combines features extracted by convolutional layers to make final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Representation**\n",
    "For input vector \\( x \\), weights \\( W \\), bias \\( b \\), and activation \\( f \\):\n",

    "y = f(Wx + b)\n",
