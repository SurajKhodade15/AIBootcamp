    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on designing algorithms that enable computers to learn patterns and make decisions from data, without being directly programmed for every possible scenario. Unlike traditional programming (where explicit rules are coded), machine learning algorithms develop their own logic based on examples and feedback, improving performance as they are exposed to more data.\n",
