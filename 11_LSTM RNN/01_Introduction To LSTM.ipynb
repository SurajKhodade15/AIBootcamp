    "## üß† What is LSTM?\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an advanced type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to **learn long-term dependencies** in sequential data. It was introduced by **Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)** to address issues like **vanishing gradients** faced by traditional RNNs.\n",

    "- LSTM incorporates **memory cells** and **gating mechanisms** to control the flow of information.\n",
