    "| **Data Input**                               | Sequential data split into batches with fixed-length sequences or variable lengths (padded). Inputs $x_t$ are fed sequentially across time steps.                                                                                                                           |\n",

    "| **Loss Computation**                         | The output at each time step is compared with the ground truth $\\hat{y}_t$ using a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification, MSE for regression).
